# Airbnb EDA
## Introduction
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb's dataset for New York City. With approximately 49,000 observations and 16 columns, including a mix of categorical and numerical values, this dataset offers a wealth of information. The insights derived from this analysis can inform various aspects of Airbnb's business strategy, including pricing, market segmentation, competitive analysis, and customer satisfaction.

## EDA
### Frequency distribution of prices of rooms
The histogram analysis reveals crucial insights about room prices:

**Skewness:** The distribution of room prices is right-skewed, indicating more listings with lower prices and fewer with higher prices. This skew is evident from the taller bars on the left side of the histogram.

**Central Tendency:** The mean price is $152.72, higher than the median of $106, suggesting a skew towards higher prices due to a few listings with very high rates.

**Outliers:** There are very few listings with prices above $300, and almost none above $500, hinting at potential outliers in the dataset affecting the overall distribution.

**Pricing Strategy:** Airbnb and hosts can optimize pricing strategies based on these insights, ensuring competitive and attractive rates.

**Market Segmentation:** Price skewness helps identify distinct customer segments based on their price sensitivity, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

**Competitive Analysis:** Airbnb can benchmark its prices against competitors and identify areas for improvement.

**Potential Lost Revenue:** Failure to adjust prices according to these insights may result in lost revenue due to decreased competitiveness.

**Customer Dissatisfaction:** Setting prices too high based on outliers may lead to customer dissatisfaction, negative reviews, and reduced bookings.
