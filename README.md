# Airbnb EDA
This project aims to analyze the Airbnb dataset containing information on millions of listings provided through the platform. The dataset has around 49,000 observations and 16 columns, including categorical and numeric values. This data can provide insights into various aspects of the business, including customer behavior, host performance, marketing initiatives, and additional services.

The project will use various libraries to analyze the dataset, including Pandas for data manipulation and aggregation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, and NumPy for computationally efficient operations. The project will generate at least five visualizations to explore the data and gain insights.

The analysis will focus on identifying key trends and patterns in the data. This may include identifying popular neighborhoods and types of listings, understanding pricing and availability trends, and analyzing the relationship between customer reviews and host performance. The project will also aim to identify any outliers or anomalies in the data, which may provide further insights into customer behavior or business performance.

Airbnb can use the insights gained from this analysis to make data-driven decisions and improve the platform. For example, by identifying popular neighborhoods and types of listings, Airbnb can focus on expanding its offerings. By understanding pricing and availability trends, Airbnb can optimize its pricing strategy and improve the customer experience. By analyzing the relationship between customer reviews and host performance, Airbnb can identify areas for improvement and provide better support to its hosts.
